# Gaze Estimation

### 1. Project Overview

This is a task to predict **where** a person is looking at given the personâ€™s full face. 

Two directions of task:

- 3-D gaze vector estimation is to predict the gaze vector, which is usually used in the automotive safety.
-  2-D gaze position estimation is to predict the horizontal and vertical coordinates on a 2-D screen, which allows utilizing gaze point to control a cursor for human-machine interaction.

usability: track the eye movement, provide detailed insights into users' attention.

challenges: (a) low sensor quality or unknown/challenging environments, and (b) large variations in eye region appearance.

### 2. timeline

Week 3-4: Dataset observation, general idea on estimation.

Week 4-5: In-depth learning for Appearanced-based gaze in-the-wild.

Week 6: Implement multi-modal CNN for one-eye gaze estimation.

Week 7-8: improve some techniques applied to the data.
